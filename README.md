A python program to play chess against an AI in the terminal. The semester project that I have made for this course is a Recreational and a Competitive board game played between two players known as CHESS GAME. The Chess game follows the basic rules of chess, and all the chess pieces only move according to valid moves for that piece. My implementation of Chess is for a player and an AI Agent. It is played on an 8x8 checkerboard.
